<p>On the next page, you will interact with a recommender system where you can rate movies and books and receive recommendations. Please use this system to find a book you would be interested in reading. You may spend up to 30 minutes on this task.</p>

<h4>Bellow, is the instruction, which will help you to use the system.</h4>

<p>In the system, you can find a book similar to a set of books or movies. The system narrows down your search intentions as you hit the following buttons:</p>
    <button>Less like this</button> <button>More like this</button>

<p>After you hit one of these buttons, the system will suggest a book or a movie to you based on the feedback you provided. You can provide your feedback as much as you want.</p>
<p>To switch between books and movies, use the following control:</p>
    <input type="radio" id="movies_radio" name="domain" value="movies" onchange="updateDomain('movies')" checked>
    <label for="movies_radio">Movies</label>
    <input type="radio" id="books_radio" name="domain" value="books" onchange="updateDomain('books')">
    <label for="books_radio">Books</label>

<p>To look for a particular book or movie, use the search field:</p>
<span>Find: </span><input>

<p>At any time, you can restart the recommendation process. For example, this might happen if you decide to look for a different kind of book, or just think that the system does not capture your tastes correctly. To restart, hit the following button:</p>
    <button>Start Again</button>

<p>At any time, you can edit the feedback you provided:</p>
    <button >Activity History (5)</button>

<p>At any time, you can also bookmark a movie or a book you found interesting and see them in the list of saved items:</p>
    <button>Save</button><button>Saved Picks (3)</button>


<p>If you found a book that interests you, you should hit the following button:</p>
    <span>This is the book I would be interested in reading</span>
    <button>Finish</button>

<p>Please select all the correct statements to proceed:</p>
