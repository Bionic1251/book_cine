<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This experiment is conducted by researchers from the University of Strathclyde and the University of Helsinki.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we will ask you to interact with a recommender system, which recommends movies and books and reply to a survey after this interaction. This experiment consists of four pages: introduction, task, post-task survey and finish. You can spend up to 30 minutes on the task itself and up to 30 minutes on the rest of the experiment, although most participants complete the entire process in around 10 minutes. The total time is flexible, but please do not exceed the 30-minute limit. Each page will provide more detailed instructions as you progress.</p>
<p>By proceeding with this experiment, you agree with the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You understand the nature of your participation and any potential risks involved.</li>
    <li>Any questions you have about the experiment have been answered to your satisfaction.</li>
    <li>The data collected about you will be stored until the end of the project, solely for research purposes.</li>
    <li>Your information will be treated with strict confidentiality</li>
    <li>Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the experiment at any time.</li>
    <li>You have the right to request the withdrawal of your data if desired.</li>
    <li>In agreeing to participate in this investigation you should be aware that you may be entitled to compensation for accidental bodily injury, including death or disease, arising out of the investigation without the need to prove fault. However, such compensation is subject to acceptance of the Conditions of Compensation, a copy of which is available on request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ethical approval for this study is currently being sought.</p>
